1. In step 1, which Linux commands did you use to (1) create a new folder and (2) copy
your files into a new folder?

mkdir "HW"
cp ./* HW


2. Could any of the breadth-first-search questions (shortestPath and distanceUser) be
solved with depth-first-search? Why or why not?

I do not believe the shortest path can be solved with DFS, because BFS will find the shortest path as it explores all possible paths simultaenousely--therefore whichever one 
approaches the target first is the shortest path. However, DFS will give a path, but it might not be the shortest as it goes through one path and only backtracks if it didn't reach the target.


3. Could the depth-first-search question (groups) be solved with breadth-first-search?
Why or why not?

The DFS problem can definitely be solved with BFS because they're all exploring ALL connected points of a source. However---the order may be different.

4. Can the suggestFriends problem be solved without breadth-first-search and depth-first-
search?

You might be able to do it with recursive backtracking---same logic but it's much slower.

5. Using big-O notation, what is the runtime of your shortestPath implementation in
terms of n (the number of vertices) and/or m (the number of edges)?

O(M + N)

6. Using big-O notation, what is the runtime of your groups implementation in terms of
n (the number of vertices) and/or m (the number of edges)?

O(M + N)

7. In hours, (approximately) how much time did you spend on this assignment? (there
are no wrong answers)

4-5 hours (excluding extra credit). Including extra credit 8-10hours
